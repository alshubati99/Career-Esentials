# [Course Certificate](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/certificates/d899fcdea4c4c9980bcd42081b4f3d33e41d9183bf8a8eecd00644648f454ef1)

### Collection:
- Grouping related mulitple items togather. (Organize related data)
- Uses code structure to indicate that multiple pieces of data are related. 
- Avoids creating a potentially huge number of variables to track within the code. 
- Offers simplified syntax. 
- Lists, Dictionaries, Tuple = immutable data in python
- index numbering starts at 0 not at 1. 

### Iteration:
- Repeat the same prosedure multiple times until it reaches a specified end point the => loops
- Specify the data
- Specify what should happend to the data during each iteration. 
- Indicate when the loop should stop.
- Infinite loop: a program that never stops.  
### Types of external code:
- Module: file contains code. 
- Package or a library: multiple modules.
- Framework: a set of code used in a specific way. 
### Python Libraries:
- TenserFlow
- pandas
- NumPy
- SciPy
### Python Frameworks: 
- Django
- Flask
- jQuery: JS library. 
- Angular, React, Vue: Js Frameworks

### String is a collection of characters. 
- Regular expressions: \d for digits ...
- Slicing: getting parts of a string. 
### Choosing a code style: 
- Python Style Guides => pep8
- Pseudocode => create a basic outline of the program. 

### I/O Files.
### Debugging:
- Use IDE to help catch bugs. 
- IDE does: Syntax highlighting, Autocompletion, Linting.
- Linting: informs you if you did something wrong. 
- Error massages. 
- Test cases. 

### Object-oriented Programming:
- Structure the code and organize it. 
- Each object has attributes and properities. 
- You create object using a blueprint called a class. 
- Eleminates repeatitive code. 

### Advanced Topics in Programming:
- Memory management across languages.
    - Computers storage: Drive for programs and data, Memory for running code and results. 
    - Garbage Collection=> done automatically in some languages. 
- Multithreading.
- Algorithms.
