### What does a programmer do?
- Design develop and test software. 
- Ensure that the software is efficient. 

### How do they know what to develop?
- Work with a team to know what software to be developed. 
- Design, develop, test, write code. 
- Ensure the health and reliablity of the programs they develop. 
- programers spend more time reading code than writing it. 
### Activities Programmers do:
- Prepare for the week ahead.
- Meet with teams to discuss preiorities. 
- Work in a team to work on new features. 
- Do research on what to develop. 
- Write code.
- Debug issues=> finding or removing errors in the code. 
- Run the code. 
- Write tests to ensure what the programmers did. 
- Show thier work to their managers. 

### Challenges for this career: 
- Naming  => when writing code, each class, file and variable can have a name. 
- Working with legacy code => code that you are affraid to change. 
- Providing estimates => how long it takes to provide a code. 
    - how many hours of coding will they have. 
    - what type of research is needed beforehand. 
    - Will it be easy or difficult to wirte tests for this feature. 
    - Do they need to provide documentations for other. 
- "The only constant in the tecknology industry is change" Marc Benioff - CEO of Salesforce.com 
- to keep up with the new changes = subscribe to a newsletter or podcasts, join tech communities. 
- Software = set of instructions to tell the computer what to do: 
### Types of software: 
1. System software: operating systems. 
2. Application software: help users perform a specific task such as chat applications. 
3. Programming software: tools programmers need to write their code. 
### Software Development Life Cycle SDLC: 
##### 7 phases: 
1. Requirements gathering: to know what is needed in a software.  
2. Analysis: identify risks and document the high level goals.
3. Design: how varius components are fit together. 
4. Coding: longest phase. 
5. Testing: to ensure the reliablity. 
6. Deployment: the program is already available for customers. 
7 Maintaining: updates or changes done to software.
### Development Team: 
- Business stakeholder. 
- Product Manager (PM).
- User experience and user interface designers. 
- Programmers. 
    - FrontEnd Programmer. 
    - BackEnd Programmer. 
    - Fullstack Programmer. 
- Quiality Assurance Engineer. 
### Tools used for software development: 
- Whiteboard.

- Paper and Pincel. 
### Project management software: 
- Define each task. 
- Assign it to the appropriate person. 
- Monitor the time it takes. 
- Monitor company budget. 
- IDE is used by programmer to write software.
### Software Deployment: 
- Delivering the software to customer. 
### Version Control Systems (VCS): 
- Tools to help the software team to manage software changes overtime.
    - *VCS Benefits*: 
    - History of changes. 
    - Simultanous work. 
    - Troubleshooting. 
- Git: Free and open source, uses branching model. 
### Repository Hosting Services: 
- Third-party web applications that wrap and enhance a version control system => Github, Bitbucket. 
### Library: 
- Code that someone else has written and developed. 
    - Ktor = kotlen
    - NumPy = python
### Framework: 
- Serves as a blueprint for how the software project should be configured and developed. 
    - Angular = Javascript
    - Django = python
    - ASP.NET = C#
    - Laravel = PHP
### IDEs:
- Provide tools to run and debug the software. 
    - VSCode.
    - Sublime Text.
    - IntelliJ IDEA. 
### Programming Languages:
- Syntax = rules - Semantics = meanings. 
### Top Five Programming Languages:
- Pyhton.
- Java.
- C#.
- JavaScript.
- C++. 
### Object Oriented Programming:
- Classes and objects.
- Class is a blueprint of the properities of any object. 
- Helps to isolate multiple changes. 
- Helpes develop more effecient software with less bugs. 
### Modules
- Simplicity.
- Maintainability.
- Reusablility.
- random module in python => used to generate pseudo-random numbers. 
### Python in real life:
- Web development => django. 
- Animation => blender
- Image Manipulation => scikit-image
- ML and AI => pandas
### C Programming Language:
- Other languages inherit ideas from C.
- Developed in 1970s 
- Used in OS, Games, Compiling systems.
- Low level language. 
### Java Programming Language:
- Cross-platform language. 
- For Desktop applications and backend services.
### C++ Programming Language:
- For Games and Games engines. 
- Variables behave differently according to the programming language used. 
- In JS you declare and use the variable at the same time unlike Java. 
### Popular Programming Jobs:
- Software application Developer => python, java, c++, Ruby. 
- Web developer => frontend, backend, fullstack => javascript, java, python, php.
- Network Systems Administrator => python, Bash, powersell. 
- Mobile application developer => Kotlin, Swift and Dark. 
- Software Quality Assurance Engineer => Java, python, JS
### Building Portfolio:
- Start by building sample projects. 
- Contribute to open-source.  
- Internships.
- Personal blog. 
- Leecode and Algoexpert to practice your codeing skills.
- Be curious.
- Take time to practice.
- Collaborate with others.
